                <h1 class="faq-page">What will be the benefits of visiting Sri Lanka ?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>There are lots of benefits in visiting Sri Lanka. First, it is a great place to regroup during the vacation after a very hectic lifestyle. It also provides the best way to be connected with nature with all the eco-tourism going on. Touring Sri Lanka, you can get the first-hand taste in the culture which is very vibrant and most of all awe-striking. These are just a few of the many benefits that I can list.</p>
